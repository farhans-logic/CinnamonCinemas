### Cinnamon Cinemas 🎥 Business Requirements

🎥. The Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5

● Rows are assigned a letter from A to C

● Seats are assigned a number from 1 to 5

### User Story

As a 🍿 🎬 Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Manager

I want to allocate seats to customers

So that I can control reserved seating for the theatre

● GIVEN a customer wants to request some tickets

● WHEN they request a number of seats between 1 and 3 for a movie

● THEN the customer should be allocated the required number of seats
from the available seats on the seating plan

● AND the seats should be recorded as allocated

### Acceptance Criteria and Assumptions

● Write a program that allocates seats based on a random integer “number of
seats” between 1 and 3

● Your program should allocate the required number of seats from the available
seats starting from seat A1 and filling the auditorium from left to right, front to
back

● All of the seats are available for sale when the program starts

● The program should continue to allocate a random number of seats until it
finds there are not enough seats left to complete the request

● Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program
can halt
